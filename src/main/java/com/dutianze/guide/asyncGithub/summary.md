### Creating Asynchronous Methods

1. [The Spring TaskExecutor Abstraction](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#scheduling-task-executor)

2. [Executor](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/EnableAsync.html)

3. If you do not define an Executor bean, Spring creates a SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor and uses that.
